# Elixir Test Suite

Proof of concept porting the JS test suite to Elixir.

Currently the basics.js suite has been partially ported over.

To run the suite:

```
mix deps.get
mix test --trace
```

## Set CouchDB credentials

By default the Elixir tests require CouchDB running at http://127.0.0.1:15984 with credentials `adm:pass`.
You can override those using the following:

```
$ EX_USERNAME=myusername EX_PASSWORD=password EX_COUCH_URL=http://my-couchdb.com mix test
```

# Using ExUnit to write unit tests

Elixir has a number of benefits which makes writing unit tests easier.
For example it is trivial to do codegeneration of tests.
Bellow we present a few use cases where code-generation is really helpful.

## How to write ExUnit tests

1. Create new file in test/exunit/ directory (the file name should match *_test.exs)
2. In case it is a first file in the directory create test_helper.exs (look at src/couch/test/exunit/test_helper.exs to get an idea)
3. define test module which does `use ExUnit.Case`
4. Define test cases in the module

You can run tests either:
- using make: `make exunit`
- using mix: BUILDDIR=`pwd` ERL_LIBS=`pwd`/src MIX_ENV=test mix test --trace

## Test another implementation

Imagine that we are doing a major rewrite of a module which would implement the same interface.
How do we compare that both implementation return the same results for the same input?
It is easy in Elixir, here is a sketch:
```
defmodule Couch.Test.Fabric.Rewrite do
  use ExUnit.Case
  alias Couch.Test.Utils, as: Utils

  # we cannot use defrecord here because we need to construct
  # record at compile time
  admin_ctx = {:user_ctx, Utils.erlang_record(
    :user_ctx, "couch/include/couch_db.hrl", roles: ["_admin"])}

  test_cases = [
    {"create database": {create_db, [:db_name, []]}},
    {"create database as admin": {create_db, [:db_name, [admin_ctx]]}}
  ]
  module_a = :fabric
  module_b = :fabric3

  describe "Test compatibility of #{module_a} with #{module_b}" do
    for {description, {function, args}} <- test_cases do
      test "#{description}" do
        result_a = unquote(module_a).unquote(function)(unquote_splicing(args))
        result_b = unquote(module_b).unquote(function)(unquote_splicing(args))
        assert result_a == result_b
      end
    end
  end

end
```
As a result we would get following tests
```
Couch.Test.Fabric.Rewrite
  * test Test compatibility of Elixir.A with Elixir.B create database (0.01ms)
  * test Test compatibility of Elixir.A with Elixir.B create database as admin (0.01ms)
```

## Generating tests from spec

Sometimes we have some data in structured format and want
to generate test cases using that data. This is easy in Elixir.
For example suppose we have following spec:
```
{
	"{db_name}/_view_cleanup": {
		"roles": ["_admin"]
    }
}
```
We can use this spec to generate test cases
```
defmodule GenerateTestsFromSpec do
  use ExUnit.Case
  require Record
  Record.defrecordp :user_ctx, Record.extract(:user_ctx, from_lib: "couch/include/couch_db.hrl")
  Record.defrecordp :httpd, Record.extract(:httpd, from_lib: "couch/include/couch_db.hrl")

  {:ok, spec_bin} = File.read("roles.json")
  spec = :jiffy.decode(spec_bin, [:return_maps])
  Enum.each spec, fn {path, path_spec} ->
    roles = path_spec["roles"]
    @roles roles
    @path_parts String.split(path, "/")
    test "Access with `#{inspect(roles)}` roles" do
      req = httpd(path_parts: @path_parts, user_ctx: user_ctx(roles: @roles))
      :chttpd_auth_request.authorize_request(req)
    end
  end
end
```
As a result we would get
```
GenerateTestsFromSpec
  * test Access with `["_admin"]` roles (0.00ms)
```

## Generating tests for multiple APIs using test adapter

CouchDB has four different interfaces which we need to test. These are:
- chttpd
- couch_httpd
- fabric
- couch_db

There is a bunch of operations which are very similar. The only differences between them are:
- setup/teardown needs different set of applications
- we need to use different modules to test the operations

This problem is solved by using testing adapter. We would define a common protocol which we would use from test.
Then we implement this protocol for every interface we want to use.

Here is the example of how it might look like:
```
defmodule Couch.Test.CRUD do
  use ExUnit.Case
  alias Couch.Test.Adapter
  alias Couch.Test.Utils, as: Utils

  alias Couch.Test.Setup

  require Record

  test_groups = [
    "using Clustered API": Adapter.Clustered,
    "using Backdoor API": Adapter.Backdoor,
    "using Fabric API": Adapter.Fabric,
  ]

  for {describe, adapter} <- test_groups do
    describe "Database CRUD #{describe}" do
      @describetag setup: %Setup{}
        |> Setup.Start.new([:chttpd])
        |> Setup.Adapter.new(adapter)
        |> Setup.Admin.new(user: "adm", password: "pass")
        |> Setup.Login.new(user: "adm", password: "pass")
      test "Create", %{setup: setup} do
        db_name = Utils.random_name("db")
        setup_ctx = setup |> Setup.run()
        assert {:ok, resp} = Adapter.create_db(Setup.get(setup_ctx, :adapter), db_name)
        assert resp.body["ok"]
      end
    end
  end
end
```

## Test all possible combinations

Sometimes we want to test all possible permutations for parameters.
This can be accomplished using something like the following:

```
defmodule Permutations do
  use ExUnit.Case
  pairs = :couch_tests_combinatorics.product([
    [:remote, :local], [:remote, :local]
  ])
  for [source, dest] <- pairs do
    @source source
    @dest dest
    test "Replication #{source} -> #{dest}" do
     assert :ok == :ok
    end
  end
end
```

This would produce following tests
```
Permutations
  * test Replication remote -> remote (0.00ms)
  * test Replication local -> remote (0.00ms)
  * test Replication remote -> local (0.00ms)
  * test Replication local -> local (0.00ms)
```
